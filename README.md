# Knuqull
A handled low-pro case for the [QAZ PCB](https://www.cbkbd.com/product/qaz) based on the existing [Qull](https://www.cbkbd.com/product/qull) case for QAZ and [KnuckHull](https://trashman.wiki/community/cases/knuckhull) case for minivan

## Features
- Low-pro design
- Handle for convenient carrying and looking cool
- Compatible with integrated QAZ PCBs and Qull plates 
- Cutouts for 3/4" feet
- Models for CNC machining and 3D printing
  - Machined models have holes to be tapped for M2 screws
  - 3D printing models have holes for M2 heatset inserts
- Open source permissive license ([CERN-OHL-P](https://cern-ohl.web.cern.ch/home))

## Want one?

All relevant STL and STEP files for production can be found in their respective version folders.

*New 3D printing files with a shorter handle for more printer compatibility were provided by l2yuk3n's buddy and l2yuk3n who asked to be credited as "online friendly peoples," many thanks to them!*

*There are untested "Wider Port" files for 3D printing and CNC-ing*
- These files have more room beneath the PCB and a taller (and slightly wider) USB port to (hopefully) allow a pro-micro QAZ pcb to be used
 
**Additional parts needed:**
- Integrated QAZ PCB and [Qull plate](https://github.com/CoffeeBreakKeyboards/Qull-Documentation)
- 4 M2 screws
  - 4 M2x4mm heatset inserts (if 3D Printing)
- 4 3/4" feet (cork or rubber)

## QA Notes
- Careful with flexible plates as bottoming out becomes an issue
  - There is roughly 2mm of space between the hotswap sockets (if using) and the case bottom
- The case's bottom is roughly 2mm thick, a smidgeon thinner than Hull
- It is unlikely the USB port lines up for use with promicro QAZs
- Feet holes may be a little big for your tastes, I overestimated
- **I have a machined stainless steel case using an aluminum plate and a v2 Hotswap (integrated) PCB. *No other configurations have been tested***

TL;DR: Files are provided as is and I accept no liability if they aren't good
